##Atomic Vectors
```{r}
vect <- seq(from = 1, to = 10)
#could also do this as vect <- 1:10

#Keep 1 through 4 and 7
vect[c(seq(1,4), 7)]

#Keep 1 through 8 and 10
vect[c(-9)]

#Keep all elements greater than 5
vect[vect>5]

#keep all elements divisible by 3 
#%% = remainder
vect[vect %% 3 == 0]


``` 

##List Vectors
str will tell you the structure

Lists can store different types of vectors

With double brackets you can isolate the element by column and row as atomic vector
one set of brackets gives you back a list

```{r}
x <- list(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = "a string", c = pi, d = list(-1, -5))
str(x)

x[[1]]

str(x["c"])

x[c(1, 3 )]
```

##for loop

mode - sets what type of vector it will be
