Function 
-everything in {} is the body of the function

-slide 11 fuction rescales the smallest value to zero

-anything returned by the function is not stored unless you turn into an object 

-don't need a piped operator in the function.


```{r}
sum_of_squares <- function(a,b){
  sum_squares <- (a^2 + b^2)
  return(sum_squares)
}

sum_of_squares(4, 4)
```



- if function stops after it finds the first value that is true
-if_else allows you to test all data
-ifelse - base R
-if_else - dplyr
-if_else - more robust and less prone to errors, use it instead of ifelse



```{r}
fizzbuzz <- function(a){
  
}
```

want to test for fizzbuzz first because it is the most selective condiditon
